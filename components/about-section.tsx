              I'm a designer and developer who specializes in "vibe coding" â€” creating digital experiences that not only
              function flawlessly but feel right. With years of experience in the startup ecosystem, I've learned that
              the best products are built at the intersection of beautiful design and thoughtful engineering.

            <p>
              My approach combines rapid prototyping with modern tools like v0, Cursor, and Next.js to bring ideas to
              life quickly without sacrificing quality. I believe in shipping fast, iterating based on real feedback,
              and always keeping the user experience at the forefront.

              Whether you're a startup looking to build your MVP or an established company seeking to refresh your
              digital presence, I bring a unique blend of design sensibility, technical expertise, and startup hustle to
              every project.
