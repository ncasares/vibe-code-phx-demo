              I&apos;m a designer and developer who specializes in &ldquo;vibe coding&rdquo; â€” creating digital experiences that not only
              function flawlessly but feel right. With years of experience in the startup ecosystem, I&apos;ve learned that
              the best products are built at the intersection of beautiful design and thoughtful engineering.

            <p>
              My approach combines rapid prototyping with modern tools like v0, Cursor, and Next.js to bring ideas to
              life quickly without sacrificing quality. I believe in shipping fast, iterating based on real feedback,
              and always keeping the user experience at the forefront.

              every project.
